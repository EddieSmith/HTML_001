			This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone
			knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators
			have fine-grained control over who can do what; and it’s far easier to administer
			a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.

			However, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the
			single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for
			an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes
			to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes
			corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything—the
			entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on
			their local machines.
			<br>
			Local VCS systems suffer from this same problem—whenever
			you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.
